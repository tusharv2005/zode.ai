// Regression guard for branding drift in user-facing MCP strings.
//
// History: upstream OpenCode has repeatedly overwritten the Zode-branded
// toast message and MCP client `name` field during large refactors — most
// recently in upstream PR #22913 (commit 5fccdc9fc, "refactor: collapse mcp
// barrel into mcp/index.ts") which Zode picked up via the v1.4.7 merge (PR
// #9346, commit 57630eaf1). The original fix was PR #7174.
//
// This test asserts the surviving Zode-branded strings directly against the
// source so that the next upstream churn on this file fails the Zode test
// suite instead of shipping an "opencode mcp auth" popup to end users.
