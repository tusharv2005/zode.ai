# Changing Models

The Control UI Chat tab doubles as a command line for model management. ZodeClaw exposes 335+ models through the `zodecode` provider and you can browse and switch between them without leaving the chat.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/model status` | View the currently active model and provider |
| `/models zodecode` | Browse available models (paginated, 20 per page) |
| `/models zodecode <page>` | Jump to a specific page (e.g. `/models zodecode 2`) |
| `/model zodecode/<provider>/<model>` | Switch to a specific model (e.g. `/model zodecode/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`) |
| `/models zodecode all` | List every available model at once |

Each `/models` response includes helper text at the bottom with shortcuts for switching, paging, and listing all models.

To change the default model for all new sessions, edit `agents.defaults.model.primary` in your `openclaw.json` via **Config** in the Control UI (or the [ZodeClaw Dashboard](/docs/zodeclaw/dashboard#changing-the-model) for a quick dropdown pick).

For the full list of providers, advanced configuration, and CLI commands, see the [OpenClaw Model Providers documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers).
